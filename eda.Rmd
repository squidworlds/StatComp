## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gridExtra)
demand <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Ella Park\\Desktop\\Year 3\\Sem 2\\Statistical Computing\\Project02\\Project02\\SCS_demand_modelling.csv")
```

## Scatter plots for exploratory data analysis

```{r demand  scatters, echo=FALSE}
# Wind vs demand
wind_plot <- ggplot(demand, aes(x=wind, y=demand_gross)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5, color="green") +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="red") +
  labs(title="Peak Demand vs Wind Capacity Factor", x="Wind Capacity Factor", y="Peak Demand (MW)") +
  theme_bw()

# Solar vs demand
solar_plot <- ggplot(demand, aes(x=solar_S, y=demand_gross)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5, color="orange") +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="red") +
  labs(title="Peak Demand vs Solar Capacity Factor", x="Solar Capacity Factor", y="Peak Demand (MW)") +
  theme_bw()

# Temp vs demand- shows negative correlation
temp_plot <- ggplot(demand, aes(x=temp, y=demand_gross)) +
   geom_point(alpha=0.5, color="blue") +
   geom_smooth(method="lm", color="red") +
   labs(title="Peak Demand vs Temperature", x="Temperature (Â°C)", y="Peak Demand (MW)") +
   theme_bw()

# Year vs demand- shows negative correlation
year_plot <- ggplot(demand, aes(x=year, y=demand_gross)) +
   geom_point(alpha=0.5, color="blue") +
   geom_smooth(method="lm", color="red") +
   labs(title="Peak Demand vs Year", x="Year", y="Peak Demand (MW)") +
   theme_bw()

grid.arrange(wind_plot, solar_plot, temp_plot, year_plot, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)
```

Wind vs demand- very little effect, lm probably has small coefficient. Could this be excluded from the model, give a lower AIC because we favor simpler models. Prove this from the regression.

Solar vs demand- I don't quite know

Temp vs demand- negative correlation. This will definitely useful in the model. Is there a better option though, eg TE, TO.

Year vs demand- definitely important as there is a correlation but maybe not linear.

```{r exploring year, echo=FALSE}
year_quadratic <- ggplot(demand, aes(x=year, y=demand_gross)) +
   geom_point(alpha=0.5, color="blue") +
   geom_smooth(method="lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), color="red") +  
   labs(title="Peak Demand vs Year", x="Year", y="Peak Demand (MW)") +
  theme_bw()

year_cubic <- ggplot(demand, aes(x=year, y=demand_gross)) +
   geom_point(alpha=0.5, color="blue") +
   geom_smooth(method="lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 3), color="red") +  
   labs(title="Peak Demand vs Year", x="Year", y="Peak Demand (MW)") +
  theme_bw()

show(year_quadratic)
show(year_cubic)
```
Include year as quadratic or cubic as these are far better.

## Categorical variables EDA

We compare these using violin plots.

```{r violin, echo=TRUE}
# Day of week
day_plot <- ggplot(demand, aes(x=factor(wdayindex), y=demand_gross, fill=factor(wdayindex))) +
  geom_violin(alpha=0.5) +  # Create the violin plot
  geom_boxplot(width=0.2, color="black", alpha=0.7) +  # Add a boxplot inside the violin for quartiles
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set3") +  
  labs(title="Peak Demand by Day of the Week", x="Day of Week (0=Sunday)", y="Peak Demand (MW)") +
  theme_bw()

# Month vs demand
month_plot <- ggplot(demand, aes(x=factor(monthindex, levels = c(10, 11, 0, 1, 2)), y=demand_gross, fill=factor(monthindex))) +
  geom_violin(alpha=0.5) +  # Create the violin plot
  geom_boxplot(width=0.2, color="black", alpha=0.7) +  # Add a boxplot inside the violin for quartiles
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set3") +  
  labs(title="Peak Demand Distribution by Month", x="Month", y="Peak Demand (MW)") +
  theme_bw()

grid.arrange(day_plot, month_plot, ncol = 2, nrow = 1)
```


Both seem important as there are large variations between groups so we hypothesise they will be both be useful and significant.

## Comparing interactions



## Basic models
```{r m_0, echo=FALSE}
m_0 <- lm(demand_gross ~ wind + solar_S + temp + factor(wdayindex) + factor(monthindex), data = demand)

m_0_year <- lm(demand_gross ~ wind + solar_S + temp + factor(wdayindex) + factor(monthindex) + year, data = demand)

m_0_year_to <- lm(demand_gross ~ wind + solar_S + TO + factor(wdayindex) + factor(monthindex) + year, data = demand)

m_0_year_te <- lm(demand_gross ~ wind + solar_S + TE + factor(wdayindex) + factor(monthindex) + year, data = demand)

m_0_year_squared <- lm(demand_gross ~ (wind + solar_S + temp + factor(wdayindex) + factor(monthindex) + year)^2, data = demand)

m_0_year_to_squared <- lm(demand_gross ~ (wind + solar_S + TO + factor(wdayindex) + factor(monthindex) + year)^2, data = demand)

m_0_year_te_squared <- lm(demand_gross ~ (wind + solar_S + TE + factor(wdayindex) + factor(monthindex) + year)^2, data = demand)

summary(m_0)
summary(m_0_year)
summary(m_0_year_squared)
summary(m_0_year_to)
summary(m_0_year_te)
summary(m_0_year_to_squared)
summary(m_0_year_te_squared)
```

Should include year, use te instead of temp and probably squared
